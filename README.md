- 👋 Hi, I’m Rabby Mir.
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning into a career into the tech space particularly in software engineering. My background is a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering with experience in product development and electrical audio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Django web framework to create a webapp based off of my own excel based VBA personal finance tracker. 
- 💞️ I’m open to collab - I'm planning to contribute to open source projects like https://github.com/triplea-game/triplea and https://github.com/up-for-grabs/up-for-grabs.net
- 📫 How to reach me - find me on linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/rabbymir
- 🚧 My Github is under construction! I have a number C++ projects using Open CV that I will upload. I have also taken the infamous CS50 course at the end of 2021, which unfortunately does not show up under my commits!
